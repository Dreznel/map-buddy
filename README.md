# Map Buddy
A small tool to draw and display dungeons room-by-room.

## Project Goals
By the time I'm finished with this project, I want to be able to:
- Draw rooms on a canvas either with a mouse or touchscreen. (Touchscreen is mandatory for this to be useful to me).
- Save and reload previous drawings in a convenient toolbar.
- Load different background images for the drawing space (graph paper, hex paper, etc.)
- Continuously push out an image of the current room to other people via a URL I can send. I will probably accomplish this with web-sockets and MobX.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the prerequisites installed. Clone this repository and open
a command line in the project's top-level directory. Then, simply run:

```
yarn install
```

followed by:

```
yarn start
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and the Yarn package manager installed to run this application. You may be able to use NPM instead of Yarn, but I am personally using Yarn.

## Built With
